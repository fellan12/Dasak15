Log onto cloaknet

when at the frontpage, refresh the page and capture the request using burp.

In the request header params-tab there is a cookie called userid, there I injected the script.

-71934/**/unUNIONion/**/seSELECTlect/**/*/**/from/**/users

The way I came up with the script is that i first negated the original id by adding a "-" at the start
then i needed to inject the and any whitespace looked like it got changed to some url encoding
 or something so i used /**/ comment as space. 

the reason to why i wrote UNION as unUNIONion is because i though that the filter removed keyword
such as select, union, from. So i tried all the combinations to find which would work.

when i got that to work i needed to find the correct table with all the users. 
So i tired username, user, profil, profiles, logs and then users. And that worked. logs seems to work
too but not here.

So this is the solution for the SQL injection.
-71934/**/unUNIONion/**/seSELECTlect/**/*/**/from/**/users
